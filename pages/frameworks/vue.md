Corber supports live reload and injection of cordova and cordova plugins during live reload but requires some setup.

In order to use `corber start` and `corber serve` with cordova & cordova plugin objects, your Vue config must be updated to add the `corber-webpack-plugin` which has been automatically installed during `corber init`. Configuration must be also added to Vue config.

##### Vue CLI 3 Projects

Vue.js projects created with Vue CLI 3 will need to ensure their `vue.config.js` file contains `new CorberWebpackPlugin()` within its plugins array. If `vue.config.js` does not exist, add it to the Vue project's root. Below is a minimal config file to get started:

```javascript
const CorberWebpackPlugin = require('corber-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  baseUrl: './',
  configureWebpack: {
    plugins: [new CorberWebpackPlugin()]
  }
}
```
###### Vue CLI 2 Projects

Vue.js projects created with Vue CLI 2 will need to ensure `build/webpack.dev.conf` contains `new CorberWebpackPlugin()` within its plugins array. If `webpack.dev.conf` does not exist, add it to the `build` folder in the Vue project's root. Below is a minimal config file to get started:

```javascript
const CorberWebpackPlugin = require('corber-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
    baseUrl: './',
    plugins: [new CorberWebpackPlugin()]
  }));
}
```

###### Non-Vue CLI Projects

Non-Vue CLI project should refer to the docs on extending frameworks.
