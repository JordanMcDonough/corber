Corber is still under active development, and we encourage you
reaching out with bugs and confusing points. There are two main support
avenues:

#### Github Issues ([link](https://github.com/isleofcode/corber/issues))

Please use issues to report bugs, edge cases and faulty implementations
/ documentation.

#### Slack

With the deprecation of the emberjs slack we no longer provide active support in that channel.

In the interim we have created a new slack group where support is being offered: https://corber-slack.herokuapp.com
